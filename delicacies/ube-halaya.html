        <h2>Ube Halaya</h2>
        <p>Ube Halaya is the purple gem of Filipino desserts! Made from mashed purple yam, it's creamy, sweet, and oh-so-satisfying. With its rich, velvety texture and that distinct nutty-vanilla flavor, it's the kind of treat that feels like a warm hug from nanay. Whether it's spread on bread, topped on halo-halo, or eaten straight out of the jar (we won't judge!), ube halaya is a fan favorite that never goes out of style. It's the dessert that says, "Life's better in purple!"</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Ube:
                <ul>
                    <li>If using fresh ube, boil it until soft, peel, and mash thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>If using powdered ube, rehydrate it according to package instructions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>In a large, non-stick pan, combine the mashed ube, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and coconut milk.</li>

                    <li>Keep stirring until the mixture is thick and smooth, and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan (about 30â€“40 minutes).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cool and Serve:
